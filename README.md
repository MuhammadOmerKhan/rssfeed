RSS Feed
Create RSS Feed in ASP.NET MVC

If you're looking for the RSS Feed creator in ASP.NET MVC, this project helps you to build your desired RSS Feed which can be hook from your database. I've used Microsoft.SyndicationFeed library to get the desired result.

Link where you can see your feed after downloading the code: http://localhost:{port}/rss
